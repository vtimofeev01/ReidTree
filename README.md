# ReidTree
Imlementation of tree search algoritm for best cosine similarity
Was made for
- no start list of vectors, they will be added dinamicaly
- hierarchy is made on maximum cross similarity on each level

Example of Ttree
- left - maximum similarity on each level
- Node to Node connections - similarity between nodes
- blue/red - example of search
- - red - best fit path
- -  blue - all other checked values
         can be reduced by parameters of Tree

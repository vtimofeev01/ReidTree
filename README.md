# ReidTree
Implementation of tree search algorithm for best cosine similarity
Was made for
- no start list of vectors, they will be added dynamically
- hierarchy is made on maximum distance om each level
<br>
How it works:<br>
- each node has maximum levels<br>
- there is a "stop" value, when the search stops<br>
- to reduce a size of tree is set the value, when similarity reaches them vector will not be added, but better not less than .99<br>

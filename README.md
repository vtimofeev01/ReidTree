# ReidTree
Implementation of tree search algorithm for best cosine similarity
Was made for
- no start list of vectors, they will be added dynamically
- hierarchy is made on maximum cross similarity on each level

<br>
There is example:<br>

- blue/red are used by vector search
- red - the "best fit" path
